# Day 4
Javascript? why not.

Running requires node. I normally install via [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating).

```bash
echo part1 | cat - input.txt | node day4.js
echo part2 | cat - input.txt | node day4.js
```

# Part 1
Count neighbours in an ascii map.

# Part 2
Repeat above, removing points with <4 neighbours.


# Thoughts
JS is easy mode. I spent ages struggling to bend ASM to my will for this but ran out of time. Solving in 20 minutes in JS after literal hours of banging my head against the assembler is a little depressing!
