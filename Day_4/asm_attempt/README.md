# Day 4
`x86 ASM` because I hate myself.

[This](https://github.com/7etsuo/x86) was very helpful and so was [this](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html) and above all [this](https://www.nasm.us/doc/nasm03.html).

# Ran out of time!
ASM takes a while to work in but it was really fun to puzzle through basic stuff (especially if you're a noob like me). Basic stuff like iterating is just a loop & counter which is fine albeit non-ergonomic. I didn't make much use of the stack which I think I should try to use in future!
