# Day 2
`F#` because `ocaml` is for nerds.

# Part 1
Find numbers with first half of digits equal to second half from a sequence of ranges.

# Part 2
Find numbers with any number of equal sub-sequences.

# Thoughts
God, 'F#' seems to be a cool language, with built in parallel maths, strong type system, functional design... I should love it.. but I spent the majority of this solution fighting with the compiler. I guess I need more practice!
