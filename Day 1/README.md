# Day 1
Chose `c` for today for some nostalgia. Build & run via make:
```bash
make run_p1
make run_p2
```

## Part 1
Count the times where you land on zero while stepping forwards and backwards along a circular number line.

## Part 2
Count the times where you *cross* zero while stepping forwards and backwards along a circular number line.
