# Day 5
I'm `scheme`ing here, not trying to be`guile` you.

# Part 1
Read in ranges, find if subsequent list of numbers is within the given ranges.

# Part 2
Read in ranges (they overlap, mind). Count unique integers in the ranges.

# Guile thoughts
God, GNU are such academics. I'm sure there's a very good reason there's a million equality functions, and I'm sure `#\` makes sense for character literals to *someone* but it's a bit annoying if you're not a GNU person!

Complaining aside, I really liked working in lisp, it's been a while!
